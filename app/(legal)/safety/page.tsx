        Putting someone you&apos;ve never met in your goal, or turning up to play for a stranger,
        should not feel like a gamble. Here is exactly what MatchKeeper does about it, and
        what to do if something goes wrong.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Goalkeeper verification</h2>
      <p>Before a goalkeeper profile can apply to a single match, an admin checks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identity, so the person who turns up is the person you booked.</li>
        <li>Experience and playing level.</li>
        <li>That the profile hasn&apos;t previously been removed for a no-show or a complaint.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Payments held until the match is done</h2>
      <p>
        Stripe holds your payment from the moment you book, and goalkeepers tap &quot;I have
        arrived&quot; when they get to the pitch. After the match you have three days to confirm
        it went fine or report a problem. If nobody says anything and the goalkeeper checked in,
        the payment is released to them automatically. If they did not check in, we hold the
        payment and contact you both. If nobody applies to your match, you are not charged. The
        cancellation rules are on the <a href="/home#cancellations">home page</a> and in the{" "}
        <a href="/terms">Terms</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>3. If a goalkeeper doesn&apos;t show up</h2>
      <p>
        Tell us within three days of the match at{" "}
        <a href={`mailto:${CONTACT_EMAIL}`}>{CONTACT_EMAIL}</a>, and do not confirm the match as
        played. You get a full refund, and the goalkeeper receives a strike. Repeated strikes
        lead to the goalkeeper&apos;s profile being removed from the platform.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Before you meet</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the in-app chat to confirm kick-off time and the exact pitch entrance.</li>
        <li>You don&apos;t need to share your personal phone number to arrange a match.</li>
        <li>Meet at a public pitch, as with any amateur match.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Reporting a problem</h2>
      <p>
        Whether it&apos;s a safety concern, a payment issue, or behaviour that made you
        uncomfortable, tell us at{" "}
        <a href={`mailto:${CONTACT_EMAIL}`}>{CONTACT_EMAIL}</a>. During the pilot we review
        every report personally.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Emergencies</h2>
      <p>
        MatchKeeper is not an emergency service. If anyone is at immediate risk, call 999
        (or your local emergency number) first.
