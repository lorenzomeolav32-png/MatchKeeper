          MatchKeeper is currently in a pilot phase in London. This is a plain-language
          summary of how we handle your data; it will be expanded into a full UK GDPR
          policy before the service scales beyond the pilot.

      </p>

      <h2>1. What we collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Account details: name, email, city, and role (organiser or goalkeeper).</li>
        <li>Match details you post or apply to: date, location, format, price.</li>
        <li>
          Messages sent through the in-app chat, so both sides can coordinate a match.
        </li>
        <li>
          Payment information, handled entirely by Stripe. We never see or store your
          card details.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Why we collect it</h2>
      <p>
        To operate the marketplace: match organisers with keepers, process payments, review
        goalkeeper profiles, and let you contact the other side of a confirmed booking.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Who it&apos;s shared with</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The other party to a match you&apos;re booking or applying to (name, rating, price).</li>
        <li>Stripe, to process payments.</li>
        <li>
          Supabase, our database and authentication provider, which stores your account data
          on our behalf.
        </li>
        <li>Vercel, which hosts the site and provides page-view analytics.</li>
        <li>Mapbox, which provides the maps.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not sell your data.</p>

      <h2>4. Your rights</h2>
      <p>
        Under UK GDPR you can ask us to access, correct, or delete your personal data. Email{" "}
        <a href={`mailto:${CONTACT_EMAIL}`}>{CONTACT_EMAIL}</a> and we&apos;ll action it.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We keep account and booking data for as long as your account is active, plus a
        reasonable period afterwards for dispute resolution and legal record-keeping.
      </p>
