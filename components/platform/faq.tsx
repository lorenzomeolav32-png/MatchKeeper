  {
    q: "What does it cost to post a match?",
    a: (
      <>
        Posting a match and looking through applicants is free. MatchKeeper adds a 15% fee on top
        of the goalkeeper&apos;s rate, only on a match that gets confirmed. The goalkeeper sets their
        own rate, so you see the full price, rate plus fee, before you book.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "How do I know a goalkeeper is any good?",
    a: (
      <>
        Every goalkeeper profile is reviewed by a person before it can apply to a match. You can
        also see each keeper&apos;s rating and how many matches they have played through
        MatchKeeper, and read their bio before you decide. Ratings only come from completed
        bookings.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "Can I choose the goalkeeper?",
    a: (
      <>
        Yes. Goalkeepers apply to your match and you pick the one you want. You can compare them
        by rating, matches played, distance and price, and message them before you accept.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "What if no goalkeeper applies?",
    a: (
      <>
        Then nothing happens and you are not charged. You only pay when you accept a goalkeeper
        and the match goes ahead.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "Which formats and pitches do you cover?",
    a: (
      <>
        All of them: 5, 7, 9 and 11-a-side, futsal, grass and artificial turf, indoors or
        outdoors. Describe the format and surface when you post your match so goalkeepers know
        what to expect. The price is whatever the goalkeeper asks for, so it does not change with
        the format.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "When do I pay, and when is the money released?",
    a: (
      <>
        Stripe holds your payment after you book. Goalkeepers tap &quot;I have arrived&quot; when they
        get to the pitch. For three days after the match ends you can confirm that everything went
        fine or report a problem. If you do nothing and the goalkeeper checked in, the payment is
        released to them automatically when the three days are up. If they never checked in, we do
        not release it. We hold it and contact you both.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "What if the goalkeeper does not turn up?",
    a: (
      <>
        You get a full refund and the goalkeeper receives a strike. Report it within three days of
        the match so we can sort the refund. Repeated strikes get a goalkeeper removed from the
        platform. The full rules are in the <a href="#cancellations">cancellation table</a> above
        and on the <Link href="/safety">Safety page</Link>.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "What if it rains or the pitch is closed?",
    a: (
      <>
        Weather does not change the cancellation schedule, so the same time limits apply. If you
        can see bad weather coming, cancel more than 24 hours ahead and it costs nothing. If the
        venue itself closes the pitch on the day, email{" "}
        <a href={`mailto:${CONTACT_EMAIL}`}>{CONTACT_EMAIL}</a> and we will look at it case by
        case.

    ),
  },
];

const KEEPER_FAQ: QA[] = [
  {
    q: "What do I need to create a goalkeeper profile?",
    a: (
      <>
        A complete goalkeeper profile: a photo, your city, a short bio and your experience, such as
        where you have played and at what level. Not everything is required, but the more you add,
        the faster an admin can verify you and the more teams will trust you when you apply.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "How does verification work?",
    a: (
      <>
        A person reviews every goalkeeper profile by hand before it can apply to any match. A
        profile with a photo and clear experience is quicker to check than an empty one.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "Do I set my own price?",
    a: (
      <>
        Yes. You apply to each match at the rate you want, so you can ask for more when the trip is
        longer or the level is higher.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "Is it free for goalkeepers?",
    a: (
      <>
        Yes. Creating a profile and applying to matches costs you nothing, and you receive 100% of
        the rate you ask for. The 15% platform fee is added on top and paid by the team.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "When and how do I get paid?",
    a: (
      <>
        Tap &quot;I have arrived&quot; in the app when you get to the pitch. Stripe holds the
        team&apos;s payment from the moment they book, and releases it to you once the team confirms
        the match, or automatically three days after the match ends if they say nothing. If you
        forgot to check in and the team stays silent, we hold the payment and contact you both
        instead. Stripe then pays it out to your bank account on its normal payout schedule. If
        the team does not show up, you still get paid in full.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "What if I need to cancel?",
    a: (
      <>
        Cancel more than 24 hours before kick-off and nothing happens to your profile. Cancel
        later than that, or miss the match without telling anyone, and the team gets a full refund
        and you get a strike. Repeated strikes mean removal from the platform. If something comes
        up, cancel as early as you can.
