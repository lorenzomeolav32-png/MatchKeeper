# MatchKeeper — Platform Design System ("Floodlight")

Source of truth for the **authenticated platform** (`/home`, the legal pages
`/terms`, `/privacy` and `/safety` and, from phase 2, `/login`, `/signup`,
`/dashboard`, `/matches`, `/admin`).

**Out of scope:** the public validation landing at `/` ([components/landing.tsx](../../components/landing.tsx)).
It keeps the old `:root` tokens and must not be touched.

Implemented in [app/globals.css](../../app/globals.css) (section "PLATFORM DESIGN SYSTEM")
and [components/platform/](../../components/platform/).

## Status board (read this first)

Last audited: **2026-10-02**. All documents were reconciled that day:
this file, [PAYMENTS_SPEC.md](../../PAYMENTS_SPEC.md),
[PRODUCT_PLAN.md](../../PRODUCT_PLAN.md) and [TECH_STACK.md](../../TECH_STACK.md).

Naming: "phase 1" and "phase 2" in this file are the **visual redesign** phases.
The Fase 1, 2 and 3 in PRODUCT_PLAN.md are **product roadmap** phases.

### A. Done (phase 1)

- Design system: tokens, motion, components, dark and light themes.
- `/home`: hero with photo, trust marquee, mechanism stats, how it works, trust
  grid, pricing, FAQ with cancellation table, final CTA, footer.
- Legal pages `/terms`, `/privacy`, `/safety`, as draft copy.
- Copy rewritten without dashes. The 15% fee is in the site, the schema default,
  TECH_STACK.md and the Supabase database (applied by hand on 2026-10-02).
- Payments, cancellations, check-in and disputes fully specified in PAYMENTS_SPEC.md.

### B. To build, in this order (phase 2, details in section 10)

1. Goalkeeper onboarding and profile (item 8). Do first.
2. Auth: `/login` and `/signup` (item 1).
3. App shell (3), dashboards (2), matches list and detail (4) including the
   pre-acceptance chat (12), admin pages.
4. Toasts, modals and dropdowns (5, 6).
5. Structured match form fields: format and surface (11).
6. Reviews, matches-played counter, public keeper profile, distance on applicants
   (section E).
7. Approval email through Resend (9).
8. Payments, cancellations, check-in and disputes (item 10, PAYMENTS_SPEC.md). **Last.**

### C. Decisions pending

**You need to decide for phase 2:**

| # | Decision | My recommendation | Blocks |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Which profile fields a keeper must fill to be approved | Photo, city and a short bio required. Experience and level optional | Onboarding |
| 2 | When a keeper does the Stripe onboarding | Before applying, as part of approval. Then teams only see keepers who can be paid, and "Identity confirmed" is true | Onboarding |
| 3 | UI primitives for modals, dropdowns and toasts. TECH_STACK.md says shadcn/ui, but nothing is installed and the design system is custom | Keep custom components on the platform tokens. Use a headless library such as Radix only for dialog, dropdown and toast accessibility | Phase 2 components |
| 4 | Google login besides email and password. TECH_STACK.md says it is supported, the app only has email | Not now. Email and password first | Auth |
| 5 | What `/` and `/home` become. `/home` is noindex and not linked, `/` is the validation landing | Keep `/` until launch, then promote `/home` to `/` | Launch |
| 6 | Does the first public launch include payments. The site copy assumes yes, PRODUCT_PLAN.md puts payments in its Fase 2 | Launch with payments, since the copy depends on it. If not, hide the Stripe wording until they exist | Launch scope |
| 7 | Photo upload rules (Supabase Storage) | 5 MB, JPEG, PNG or WebP, shown to the admin at approval | Onboarding |
| 8 | When to show a keeper's rating | Only after 3 reviews | Profiles |
| 9 | The real support mailbox and the response time promised | Choose the mailbox. Safety says reports are reviewed personally | Launch |

**You can decide later, when payments are built:** the 9 payment decisions in
PAYMENTS_SPEC.md section 16.

### D. External blockers before a public launch

- Solicitor review of Terms, Privacy and Safety. The questions to take are in
  PAYMENTS_SPEC.md section 14.
- Company registered. Name, registration number and registered office must appear
  on the site, and the footer has none yet.
- Stripe account verified and Connect enabled. The connected-account setup is
  permanent per account, so decide it before creating the first one.
- Real domain and mailbox. `SITE_URL` and `CONTACT_EMAIL` in `lib/site.ts` are
  placeholders (`matchkeeper.app`, `hello@matchkeeper.app`).
- Accounts and keys: Resend with a verified sending domain, Sentry, a Mapbox token,
  Supabase Pro (the free project paused on 2026-10-02) and Vercel Pro (commercial use).
- Confirm the right to use the hero photo (`/hero-keeper.jpg`). It came from the
  public landing and I could not verify its source or licence.
- Check Stripe's brand guidelines for showing its wordmark. I did not verify them.
- The public landing `/` collects data through forms but links to no Privacy
  Policy. Decide when it is replaced.
- VAT on the platform fee. Ask an accountant.

### E. Claims on the site that need a feature behind them

The copy describes the finished product. Until the feature exists, the claim is
not true, so none of this should go public before it is built.

| Claim (where it appears) | Needs | Status |
|---|---|---|
| "Every keeper is reviewed by a human" (marquee, trust card, Safety) | Admin approval | Built (`/admin/goalkeepers`) |
| "In-app chat" | Chat on the match page | Built, but only after a keeper is accepted |
| "Message them before you accept" (FAQ) | One thread per application, started by the team (item 12). Today the `messages` policies in `db/policies.sql` only allow the match owner and the accepted keeper | Decided (option B), not built |
| "Free to join as a keeper" | Nothing to charge | True today |
| "Identity confirmed" (trust chip, Safety) | Stripe Connect identity check before a keeper can be chosen | Not built (payments) |
| "Experience checked" (trust chip) | Experience field and admin review | Not built (onboarding) |
| "Removed after no-shows" and strikes | Strike logic and removal | Not built (payments) |
| Ratings, "matches played", "Public rating and match history" | Reviews UI, counter, keeper profile page. The `reviews` table exists | Not built |
| "Compare by rating, matches played, distance and price" | Applicant list with those fields | Not built |
| "Read their bio", keeper photo | Profile page and upload | Not built |
| "Date, pitch, format and level" | Format and surface fields. Only a free-text level exists | Not built |
| "You see the full price, rate plus fee, before you book" | Checkout summary | Not built |
| "Goalkeepers receive 100% of their rate" | Transfer logic | Not built (payments) |
| Payments held by Stripe, cancellations, check-in, 3-day release, refunds | PAYMENTS_SPEC.md | Not built |
| "Under 2 minutes to post a match" | Measure it | Unverified |

### F. Clean-up and technical debt

- 4 lint errors that predate the redesign, in
  `app/(app)/admin/goalkeepers/page.tsx` and `app/(app)/calendar/page.tsx`
  (unescaped quotes, an impure call during render).
- Dead code: `components/audience-hero.tsx` and `components/goal-frame.tsx` are not
  used by any page. Delete after sign-off.
- Login, signup, dashboard, matches, calendar, map and admin still use the old
  light styling. The theme only applies to `/home` and the legal pages.
- Migration `0002` was applied by hand in the Supabase SQL Editor, so Drizzle's own
  history does not list it. That is the normal route here (TECH_STACK.md 1.1).
- `next build` failed once while the dev server was running (prerender error on
  `/admin/goalkeepers`) and passed on clean runs. Run a clean build before deploying.
- `accept_application` and the default `bookings.payment_status = held` must change
  when payments are built (PAYMENTS_SPEC.md section 4).

### G. Not verified, so treat as unconfirmed

- Whether a transfer to a keeper can be reversed after a lost dispute.
- Stripe's descriptor rules, what Radar includes at no cost, the exact 3D Secure
  liability shift, dispute evidence deadlines, and Vercel Cron limits.
- Legal points (Consumer Rights Act 2015, unfair terms, payment-services
  regulation). General orientation only, not legal advice.
- That the Stripe CLI and API work from the corporate laptop, which sits behind a
  VPN that inspects TLS.

## 1. Positioning

| Keyword | How the UI expresses it |
|---|---|
| Premium | Layered elevation, fluid type scale, generous whitespace, no flat 1px-only surfaces |
| Trusted | Stripe wordmark, verification chips, honest mechanism numbers, no fake social proof |
| Fast | 120–320ms micro-interactions, skeletons instead of spinners |
| Professional | One accent colour, one display face, no gradients-as-decoration |
| Sports-tech | Goal-net grid backdrop, slow floodlight beam, tabular numerals |

**Never:** club-website photography, betting-app gradients, fantasy-league badges,
WordPress section dividers, emoji icons.

---

## 2. Theming

Two themes, both first-class. Dark (`Floodlight`) is the default.

- Activated by `data-theme="dark" | "light"` on `<html>`.
- Mounted by [app/home/layout.tsx](../../app/home/layout.tsx) and
  [app/(legal)/layout.tsx](../../app/(legal)/layout.tsx) via `ThemeScope`, removed on
  unmount so `/` keeps its own `:root` tokens.
- No-flash inline script in [components/platform/theme-config.ts](../../components/platform/theme-config.ts).
- Source of truth is the DOM attribute; React subscribes via `useSyncExternalStore`
  (avoids hydration mismatch **and** `setState`-in-effect).

**To extend to a new route group:** render `<ThemeScope>` + the init script in that
segment's `layout.tsx`. Nothing else is needed.

---

## 3. Colour tokens

Semantic only. Never write a raw hex in a component.

| Token | Dark | Light | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--bg` | `#0a0c0b` | `#faf7f3` | Page base |
| `--bg-2` | `#111512` | `#ffffff` | Card |
| `--bg-3` | `#171c19` | `#f2ece4` | Raised / hover surface |
| `--surface` | `rgba(255,255,255,.04)` | `rgba(20,17,13,.025)` | Subtle fill, chips |
| `--surface-2` | `rgba(255,255,255,.07)` | `rgba(20,17,13,.05)` | Skeleton base |
| `--line` | `rgba(255,255,255,.08)` | `rgba(20,17,13,.10)` | Default border |
| `--line-strong` | `rgba(255,255,255,.16)` | `rgba(20,17,13,.20)` | Emphasised border |
| `--fg` | `#f2f5f2` | `#14110d` | Primary text |
| `--fg-2` | `#c6cdc7` | `#3a342c` | Secondary text |
| `--muted` | `#8e9891` | `#5f594f` | Tertiary text (min 6:1) |
| `--accent` | `#ff7a1a` | `#ff7a1a` | Brand, single accent |
| `--accent-strong` | `#ff9647` | `#c2410c` | Accent **text** + hover. Dark lightens, light darkens |
| `--accent-soft` | `rgba(255,122,26,.13)` | `rgba(255,122,26,.12)` | Accent fills, icon tiles |
| `--accent-ink` | `#1a1005` | `#1a1005` | Text **on** accent |
| `--success` | `#3dd68c` | `#12794a` | Confirmed, live, paid |
| `--warning` | `#ffc24b` | `#9a5b00` | Pending approval |
| `--danger` | `#ff6b6b` | `#be2c2c` | Cancelled, destructive |

### Contrast rules (non-negotiable)

- **White on `#ff7a1a` is 2.6:1 and fails WCAG AA.** Text on accent is always
  `--accent-ink`. This was a live bug in the previous design.
- `--accent-strong` is the *text* orange; `--accent` is the *surface* orange.
  Never use `--accent` for body text on `--bg-2` in light mode.
- All three text levels are >= 6:1 against `--bg` in both themes.

---

## 4. Scales

```
Radius   --r-xs 6  --r-sm 10  --r-md 14  --r-lg 20  --r-xl 28  --r-2xl 36  --r-full
Space    --s-1 4  --s-2 8  --s-3 12  --s-4 16  --s-5 24  --s-6 32  --s-7 48  --s-8 64  --s-9 96  --s-10 128
```

**Component radius convention:** chips/buttons `--r-full`; inputs and list rows
`--r-md`; cards `--r-xl`; hero / full-bleed blocks `--r-2xl`.

### Type (fluid, `clamp()` — never a fixed px headline)

| Token | Range | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `--t-xs` … `--t-lg` | 12 → 18px | Body, captions, eyebrows |
| `--t-xl` | 20 → 22px | Card title |
| `--t-2xl` | 24 → 28px | Sub-section |
| `--t-3xl` | 26 → 32px | Stat number |
| `--t-4xl` | 30 → 40px | Section H2 |
| `--t-5xl` | 36 → 52px | Block H2 (final CTA) |
| `--t-6xl` | 44 → 68px | Page H1 |

Faces: **Chakra Petch** display (`.pl-display`), **Geist** body, **JetBrains Mono**
eyebrows/metadata. Unchanged from before — they were already right.

`.pl-display` bundles `letter-spacing: -0.025em`, `line-height: 0.96`,
`text-wrap: balance`. `.pl-prose` bundles `line-height: 1.65` + `text-wrap: pretty`.
`.pl-tnum` gives tabular numerals so animated counters do not jitter.

### Elevation

`--shadow-1` … `--shadow-4` plus `--shadow-glow` (accent) and `--ring-inset`
(top highlight). Dark theme combines shadow **and** inset highlight, because a
pure shadow is invisible on a dark base — this was the single biggest "MVP tell"
in the old design.

---

## 5. Motion language

Five durations, three curves. **Nothing outside this table.**

| Token | Value | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `--d-1` | 120ms | Colour change, press |
| `--d-2` | 200ms | Hover, focus, micro-state |
| `--d-3` | 320ms | Component transform, theme switch |
| `--d-4` | 520ms | Element entrance |
| `--d-5` | 760ms | Section entrance, sheen, underline |
| `--e-out` | `cubic-bezier(.22,1,.36,1)` | Default (entrances, hover) |
| `--e-in-out` | `cubic-bezier(.65,0,.35,1)` | Symmetric loops (beam) |
| `--e-spring` | `cubic-bezier(.34,1.4,.64,1)` | Press, confirmation |

**Stagger:** 80–140ms per item. Never more — beyond ~150ms it reads as lag.

Only `opacity` and `transform` are animated (GPU-composited). Never `width`,
`height`, `top`, or `margin`.

### Named behaviours

| Class | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `.pl-reveal` (+`--soft`, `--pop`) | Scroll entrance. 3 variants so cards, text and sections do not all move identically |
| `.pl-lift` | Hover: `translateY(-3px)` + shadow step-up + accent border. Press returns to -1px |
| `.pl-spotlight` | Border glows toward the cursor (`--mx`/`--my`) |
| `.pl-btn::after` | Diagonal sheen sweep on hover |
| `.pl-btn__arrow` | Arrow advances 3px on hover |
| `.pl-underline` | Section H2 underline draws to 4rem on reveal |
| `.pl-skeleton` | Shimmer loader |
| `.pl-pulse` | Slow expanding ring for "live"/"open" dots |
| `.pl-marquee` | 42s linear loop, pauses on hover |
| `.pl-backdrop__beam` | 22s floodlight drift |
| `.pl-faq` | Native `<details>` accordion. Chevron rotates and the answer slides in |
| `.legal-copy` | Minimal prose styles for the legal pages (no typography plugin) |

Every one of these is disabled under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`, and
`usePrefersReducedMotion()` mirrors that in JS for the staged loaders.

---

## 6. Components (`components/platform/`)

| File | Exports | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `theme-config.ts` | `themeInitScript`, `THEME_STORAGE_KEY` | Server-safe, no React |

| `hero-match-card.tsx` | `HeroMatchCard` | Product mock, skeleton -> staggered rows |
| `stat-band.tsx` | `StatBand` | rAF count-up |
| `trust-marquee.tsx` | `TrustMarquee` | Duplicate copy is `aria-hidden` |
| `product-home.tsx` | `ProductHome` | The `/home` page: hero, numbers, how it works, trust, pricing, FAQ, final CTA |
| `faq.tsx` | `Faq` | Cancellation tables plus native `<details>` questions for teams and keepers |
| `site-footer.tsx` | `SiteFooter` | Shared by `/home` and the legal pages. Platform and Legal columns |
| `legal-shell.tsx` | `LegalShell` | Nav, backdrop, article and footer for Terms, Privacy and Safety |

### Button variants

| Variant | Use |
|---|---|
| `primary` | The one main action on screen |
| `secondary` | Equal-weight alternative (the "other lane") |
| `ghost` | Tertiary / navigation |
| `onAccent` | Primary **on** an accent-filled block |
| `quiet` | Secondary on an accent-filled block |

---

## 7. Layout

- Container: `max-w-[1240px]`, padding `px-5` mobile / `px-8` from `sm`.
- Section rhythm: `py-16` mobile, `py-24` desktop. Varied deliberately —
  the old uniform `py-20` everywhere is what made the page read as a template.
- Breakpoints verified: **390 / 768 / 1024 / 1440**.
- Ultrawide: content caps at 1240px; the fixed backdrop fills the rest, so the
  page never dead-stops on a blank field.

### Hero photography

The hero photo (`/hero-keeper.jpg`) is **not darkened**. The goalkeeper wears an
all-black kit, so darkening the image erases him and leaves only the white net
visible. Four dark treatments were prototyped (full bleed, right panel, top band,
diagonal) and all failed for this reason; the diagonal also cut through the
headline on mobile.

The shipped treatment keeps the photo luminous inside a bordered panel, so it
reads as a bright window in a dark page and the black silhouette separates from
the white net. Grade: `saturate(0.72) contrast(1.06)`, a 16% accent tint in
`mix-blend-overlay`, and a bottom fade into `--bg`. The match card overlaps the
panel's lower-left corner.

`next.config.ts` sets `images.formats = ["image/avif", "image/webp"]`. The hero
drops from a 603 KB JPEG source to about 36 KB of AVIF at mobile width.

**Rule for future photography:** on this dark theme use bright subjects on dark,
or dark subjects on bright. Never darken a photo whose subject is already dark.

### Fictional product data

`HeroMatchCard` shows an invented listing. It carries an `Example` chip in the
header and a footnote stating that the goalkeepers, ratings and prices are
illustrative. **Any mock data shown publicly must be labelled this way.** An
unlabelled fake listing undermines the exact trust the page is selling.

---

## 8. Accessibility checklist (applied on `/home`)

- [x] All text >= 4.5:1; muted tiers are >= 6:1
- [x] Text on accent uses `--accent-ink` (~6.5:1), never white
- [x] `.pl-focus` -> 2px accent outline, 3px offset, on every link and button
- [x] Touch targets >= 44px (`.pl-btn` min-height, 40px icon buttons with padding)
- [x] Decorative SVGs `aria-hidden`; icon-only buttons have `aria-label`
- [x] Mobile menu: `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, Escape to close, scroll lock
- [x] Loading list has `aria-busy`; marquee duplicate is `aria-hidden`
- [x] `prefers-reduced-motion` honoured in CSS **and** JS
- [x] No horizontal scroll at 390px

---

## 9. Implementation gotchas (learned the hard way)

1. **Wrap platform CSS in `@layer components`.** Unlayered CSS beats layered
   Tailwind utilities, so `.pl-btn { display:inline-flex }` silently defeated
   `hidden sm:inline-flex` and caused mobile overflow.
2. **Do not duplicate a display utility in the base class string.** Keep `display`
   in the layered CSS so consumer utilities can override it.
3. **`suppressHydrationWarning` on `<html>`** is required because the anti-flash
   script writes `data-theme` before hydration.
4. **React Compiler lint forbids sync `setState` in an effect.** Use
   `useSyncExternalStore` (theme, reduced-motion) or derive the value during render.

---

## 10. Phase 2 backlog

Ordered by impact.

1. **Auth (`/login`, `/signup`)** — split layout: form left, floodlight panel right
   with the trust chips. Inline validation, loading button state, role pre-select
   from `?role=`.
2. **Dashboard (`/dashboard`)** — replace the 2 flat link cards with: status banner
   (keeper approval state), next-match card reusing `HeroMatchCard`'s row design,
   and a real empty state.
3. **App shell (`app/(app)/layout.tsx`)** — adopt `PlatformNav` patterns: sticky
   glass header, avatar menu instead of a bare "Log out" underline, bottom tab bar
   on mobile (max 5 items).
4. **Matches list / detail** — `pl-surface` rows, applicant rows identical to the
   hero mock, `pl-skeleton` while loading, status chips using `--success` /
   `--warning` / `--danger`.
5. **Toasts** — the only motion primitive not yet built. Slide + fade, `--d-3`,
   `--e-spring`, `role="status"`, auto-dismiss 5s with hover pause.
6. **Modals / dropdowns** — scale `0.96 -> 1` + fade over `--d-3`, focus trap,
   Escape, `inert` on background.
7. **Real social proof** — once the pilot has keepers, swap the mechanism stat band
   for keeper cards (Porteroya's strongest pattern) and real testimonials.

### Product gaps found while writing `/home` copy

The `/home` copy describes behaviour the app does not have yet. Build these, or
soften the copy before anything goes public.

8. **Goalkeeper onboarding and profile (do first in phase 2).** Signup collects
   only name, email and password. There is no form for photo, bio, experience or
   level, although `profiles.avatarUrl` and `profiles.bio` already exist and the
   Home page and FAQ promise a "complete keeper profile". Design the onboarding
   with: photo upload, bio, experience, level, city. Required fields stay minimal,
   but show a profile-completeness indicator (for example "60% complete") that
   tells the keeper a fuller profile gets verified faster and earns more trust
   from teams. Experience and level need new columns, which means a migration.
9. **Approval notification email.** When an admin approves a goalkeeper, send them
   an email. Nothing is sent today, so the FAQ deliberately does not promise it.
   Once built, restore a line such as "You will get an email once yours is
   approved" to the "How does verification work?" answer in
   `components/platform/faq.tsx`. Consider the same for rejection, with a reason.
10. **Payments, cancellations, check-in and disputes (copy is live, code is not).**
    The full, implementation-ready specification lives in
    [PAYMENTS_SPEC.md](../../PAYMENTS_SPEC.md) and is the single source of truth.
    It covers the fee model, Stripe Connect setup, booking states, cancellation
    rules, the keeper check-in, release logic, dispute policy and prevention,
    schema changes, webhooks, emails, admin tools, acceptance tests, open
    decisions and the order of implementation. Build it after the rest of the
    product (pages, auth, onboarding, user and admin dashboards) is finished,
    and after a solicitor has reviewed the Terms (decided 2026-10-02). The FAQ,
    Terms and Safety already describe these rules, so keep them in sync with the
    spec if anything changes.
11. **Match form needs structured fields.** The post-a-match form only has a free
    text "Level" field. Add format (5, 7, 9, 11-a-side, futsal) and surface (grass,
    artificial, indoor) as proper fields so keepers can filter, and so the
    "Date, pitch, format and level" copy on `/home` is true.
12. **Pre-acceptance chat (decided 2026-10-02, option B).** One 1-to-1 thread per
    application, started by the team, so a team can ask a keeper questions before
    choosing. Build it with the matches detail page (item 4).
    - Schema: add `messages.application_id` (foreign key to `applications`) and keep
      `match_id`. Today the chat hangs off the match, so with several applicants they
      would share one thread. Backfill existing messages to the accepted application.
    - Access (`db/policies.sql`, idempotent, re-apply by hand): the match owner and
      that application's keeper can read and write that thread. Other applicants
      cannot see it. This replaces the current match-wide message policies.
    - Who writes first: the team. The keeper can reply only after the team's first
      message, because the keeper already has the application note and this avoids
      unsolicited messages.
    - On accepting a keeper, that thread continues. The other applicants' threads
      become read-only with a notice.
    - Safeguards: detect phone numbers and email addresses in a message before
      payment and warn or block, explaining that payment, ratings and protection only
      work inside MatchKeeper. Rate limits on messages and on new threads per match.
      Block and report buttons that feed an admin queue, with admin access to
      reported threads. Contact detection reduces leakage but cannot stop it.
    - Notifications: email on a new message through Resend, so the other side sees it.
    - Privacy: update the Privacy Policy for chat retention and its use as dispute
      evidence, and take it to the solicitor.
    - Evidence: threads feed the dispute evidence package (PAYMENTS_SPEC.md section 8).
    - Copy: the FAQ line "message them before you accept" becomes true once built.
